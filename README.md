# This repository is bullshit - ignore

The maintainers of this repo in upstream are either delusional, brain-washed, or straight-out evil.

This fork is just here to send patches in upstream, so they get more messaging on how silly and immoral they are: they will probably never realize it anyway.

This fork will retain commits/refs for documents written against their rotten cause, retaining them from deletion.
